Despite the significant impacts these programs have had, the representation of women in these efforts has been small, especially women from Francophone countries. This is due to weak technical capacity to compete in open calls, lack of confidence to compete with men on an equal footing, and language barriers, among other factors.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>This project is a fellowship program designed to respond to the need for strengthening women’s capacities in climate change research, innovation, and policy in Francophone West Africa.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>The overall objective is to develop the climate change leadership capacity of 18 early to mid-career women researchers, innovators, and policy advisors in Francophone West Africa to advance and apply knowledge in climate change adaptation and resilience.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p> Capacity Building; Policy and Advocacy</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>18</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>18</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>0</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>Université Félix HOUPHOUET BOIGNY</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Academia</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>University of Nairobi; University of Dar es Salaam</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>IDRC</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>598500</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Training women</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.idrc.ca/en/project/west-african-climate-leadership-program-women-wafriclp</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Mr. Peter Odhengo</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>odhengo@gmail.com</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
