The system generates weather predictions and information that is made available to a wide variety of users on phone and web application. Alongside that, the system will issue alerts on flood and lightning.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>The goal is to turn the project into a self sustainable business through the sale of weather products. Further we would add concrete advisory services to the weather data, e.g. use the weather data for weather index-based insurances. To achieve this, we will engage in additional marketing to help reach wider public. We will explore and implement soil related services. i.e. explore opportunities in measuring soil data, earth observation and geo-information data and translate data into useful advice.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>weather & Agroadvisory services: Tools and methodologies</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>Severe Weather Consult</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Private sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>TAHMO, TU Delft,Aqua for All</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>VIA Water</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>0.17 Million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p></p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.viawater.nl/projects/rwanda-severe-weather-warning-for-musanze-city</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
