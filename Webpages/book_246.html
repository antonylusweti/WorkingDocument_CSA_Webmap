The ACRP will serve as a roadmap for mainstreaming climate change within current agricultural policies, plans, and practices, as well as identifying gaps were new investments may be needed. It will be the guiding framework for a more comprehensive and consistent approach for confronting one of the major risks to current crop productivity and future investments.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>To develop a climate change plan that is sufficiently comprehensive to meet the needs of every food and cash crop, agro-ecological zones, or livelihoods is not realistic.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a)Implement a participatory, risk-based approach to climate action that addresses the uncertainties of climate change and identifies risks while ensuring sector policies and initiatives are resilient against a range of future scenarios; b)Develop time-bound, prioritized and costed actions to implement the NCCS strategic interventions for agriculture and food security;c)Identify entry-points to mainstream climate change adaptation and mitigation actions into MAFC’s main programmes and projects and scale up existing resilience activities;d)Strengthen the institutional framework for addressing climate change issues in MAFC and strong coordination network with GoT, sub-national and non-governmental stakeholders; e)Leverage additional financial resources from GoT, bilateral and international sources to promote climate- resilient agricultural growth. </p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Climate Smart Crops/Promotion of drought tolerant crops; Climate smart livestock practices/Livestock feed management/Improved breeds; Crop Disease and pest management; Livestock disease and pest management; Markets, credit/finance and value chains for CSA; Policy and Advocacy; Postharvest management; Renewable energy for CSA; Smart water management; Soil management; Weather & Agroadvisory Services; Capacity Building; Tools and Methodologies; Insurance</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>44 million ha</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives (MAFC)</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Government/Public sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>Technical Working Group (TWG) composed of GoT technical experts from MAFC and several other MDAs, academic institutions, NGOs, and Development Partners.
