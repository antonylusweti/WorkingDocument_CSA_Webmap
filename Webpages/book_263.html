    <p>The Strengthening Adaptation and Resilience to Climate Change in Kenya Plus (StARCK+) programme was a 29.8m,
        five-year programme with the intended impact to contribute to Kenyas achievement of its Sustainable Development
        Goals through improved response to climate change risks and opportunities. At the outcome level, its goal was to

        successful, preceeding two year StARCK programme ( 6.7m from 2011/12 to 2012/13) by supporting partnerships
        started by StARCK, as well as the implementation of new initiatives.</p>
