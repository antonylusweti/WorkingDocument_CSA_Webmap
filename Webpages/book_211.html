b) Monitoring and predicting: Developing hazard monitoring and early warning services, including weather and hydrological monitoring equipment, improving forecast capabilities and the use of these technologies within agricultural advisories, flood risk monitoring and supply chain management.
c) Disseminating information: Communicating risk information and reliable warnings to potentially affected locations through traditional and new media.
d) Responding to warnings: Building national and community response capabilities to act effectively when warnings are received.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p> Weather & Agroadvisory Services; Capacity Building; Tools and Methodologies</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>UNDP</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>UN Body</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>National Goverments</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>GEF</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>No</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>None</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.globalsupportprogramme.org/strengthening-climate-information-and-early-warning-systems-climate-resilient-development</p><h1>Location</h1><p>All ASARECA member countries</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
