Its solution-driven approach brings development part- ners and a wide range of stakeholders into design and testing to ensure relevance and ownership and facili- tate taking the solutions to scale.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>The CGIAR Research Program on livestock aims to create a well nourished, equitable and enviromentally healthy world through livestock reaseach for development. It provides research based solutions to help smallholder farmers, pastoralists and agro-pastoralists transition to sustainable, resilient livelihoods and to productive enterprises that will help feed future generations by making meat, milk and eggs more available and affordable across the developing world.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a) Ensure that appropriate livestock breeds are readily available, affordable and widely used by poor women and men livestock keepers. b) Improve livestock health and health delivery services. c) Increase livestock nutrition by identifying, testing and delivering superior feed and forage strategies and options. d) Reduce environmental footprint of livestock production across both rapid and fragile growth trajectories, while ensuring that livestock systems in target countries are able to adapt to global environmental changes. e)Maximize livetock meditated livelihoods and resilience to riskamong smallholder and pastoral producers and their communities, whilst enhancing availability and access to animal source food for rural and urban consumers.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Climate smart livestock practices/Livestock feed management/Improved breeds; Livestock Disease and pest management; Soil management</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>6'500'000</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p></p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p></p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>13.5 Million hectares</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>CGIAR</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>International Research Organization</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>ILRI,CIAT, GIZ,SLU, ICARDA</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Facilitating a transition from smallholder livestock
