The project intends to establish the potential of smallholder wheat production towards increasing food security and reducing wheat import bills in Zambia and Rwanda. This is based on the observation that most countries in Sub Saharan Africa have high wheat import bills despite the high potential for wheat self-sufficiency in some southern African countries such as Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. </p><h1>Goals</h1><p>The goal of the project is to contribute to food security and nutrition and rural incomes </p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a) To increase effectiveness and returns to investments in smallholder wheat production and value chains
b) To increase uptake of appropriate wheat technologies and management practices by smallholder wheat producers
c) To enhance evidence based created stimulates further investment in inclusive wheat security through national and regional production and processing in a competitive environment.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Climate Smart Crops/Promotion of drought tolerant crops; Markets, credit/finance and value chains for CSA; Postharvest management</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>CCARDESA </p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Regional Research Organization</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>AU, DANIDA, GIZ, German Cooperation, IFAD, CIAT, IFPRI, CIMMYT, AFAAS, ASARECA.CCAFS.
