On the other hand, in Nyagatare district where the baseline storage project is implemented, warming temperatures and longer dry spells will likely diminish surface flows, leading to water shortages and reduce groundwater recharge bringing new challenges for water management and storage. The projected impacts of climate change may increase the frequency and compound the ramifications of these events, potentially undermining food security, health, and economic growth of the communities in the catchments, with implications on the availability of water for irrigation and hydropower and for distribution by utilities. Climate change may increase the future degree of exposure and sensitivity of these ecosystems. </p><h1>Goals</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a) Strengthening landscapes for integrated, resilient inclusive, growth,

Women’s historic disadvantages— low incomes, low levels of access to technologies, limited access to finance, and a muted voice in shaping decisions—make them vulnerable to climate change. In order to respond to identified gender issues women will be encouraged and enabled to take part in decision making within established water governance structures. Skills transfer will use gender sensitive methods, in the form of learning by doing, e.g. at farmer field schools (FFS). Methods from the Gender Action Learning System will be applied, and the implementation plan for landscape restoration will include women involved in unpaid employment. The skills transfer component of the project will have long lasting and broad positive outcomes which will enable women to not only improve their capacity for increased agricultural production but also increase the non – agricultural opportunities available The program implementation M&E team will be equipped with the necessary knowledge for effective monitoring of gender indicators and collection of sex-disaggregated data, to allow measurement of the gender impact21</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.greenclimate.fund/sites/default/files/document/23450-rwanda-integrated-landscape-climate-resilient-management-program-upper-nyabarongo-catchment.pdf</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
