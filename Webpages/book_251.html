    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
    <p>The Eastern and Central Africa Agricultural Transformation Project will focus on harmonization of selected
        policies across the region to create a conducive regulatory environment for regional collaboration in
        development, transfer, and exchange of technologies which then enables sustainable regional collaboration and
        private sector investment in technology development beyond the life of the project.</p>
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p>The project will support smallholder farmers to access regional value chains through proven approaches, such as
        productive alliances, and support (at least on pilot basis) the use of regional commodity exchanges to improve
        regional integration of markets for agricultural commodities.</p>
    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p>The ECAAT project aims is to enhance regional collaboration to improve productivity, resilience, and
        competitiveness of selected agricultural commodity value chains and increase smallholder farmer access to the
        regional market for food commodities and products.</p>
    <h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1>
    <p>"(a) technologies, innovations, and management practices for example improved varieties and breeds; (b)
        capacities created in the regional centers of leadership/excellence for example laboratories, databases and
        information; and (c) formal networks of competent scientists to underpin sustainable collaboration; (d)
        harmonized regional policies and improved capacity for policy analysis; (e) gene banks for germplasm
        conservation; (f) reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; (g) regional platforms for access to formal
        markets e.g. productive alliances and regional commodity exchanges. "</p>
