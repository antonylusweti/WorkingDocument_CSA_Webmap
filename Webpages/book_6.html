In addition, the project will support communities increase their on-farm rain water harvesting and storage capacity to enhance their access to clean water even during extended dry spells which have become more frequent.  </p><h1>Goals</h1><p>The project will mainly focus on promoting and upscaling of on-farm soil and water conservation initiatives and practices that the communities are already employing and therefore no new practices will be introduced.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a) To increase the infiltration capacity of the soils within the landscape; 
b) To increase surface roughness to reduce runoff velocity; 
c) To increase landscape soil stability to reduce its vulnerability to erosion; 
d) Support community peer to peer learning on soil and water
