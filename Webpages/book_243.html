This will be the project's first Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in the country, the improvement of national food security, and the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade. Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the 2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage is critically important in the context of high international fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices. The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on grain production. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the commitment would be defined within the next phase of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the development of this commitment has been postponed to allow for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and performance. The new ASDP funding is now only expected to be available in late 2013. The AF will support the maintenance of the subsidy program during the 2012/13 gap year.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>to contribute to higher food production and productivity in targeted areas by improving farmers' access to critical agricultural inputs.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Climate Smart Crops/Promotion of drought tolerant crops; Climate smart livestock practices/Livestock feed management/Improved breeds; Crop Disease and pest management; Livestock disease and pest management; Markets, credit/finance and value chains for CSA; Policy and Advocacy; Postharvest management; Renewable energy for CSA; Smart water management; Soil management; Weather & Agroadvisory Services; Capacity Building; Tools and Methodologies; Insurance</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>1'500'000</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>450'000</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>1'050'000</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE FOOD SECURITY AND COOPERATIVES</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Government/Public sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>IBRD/IDA</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>25.00 million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P132780</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>M.
