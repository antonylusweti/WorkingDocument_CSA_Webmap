Specifically, to building five capacities identified by MoA and MANRLF related to Agriculture Climate Resilience Plan</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Capacity building; Weather and agroadvisory; Capacity 1: To determine the potential benefits and trade-offs of CSA practices, with an emphasis on resilience, under different local climate scenarios by region and cropping system.
Capacity 2: To select CSA practices for specific cropping systems and regions and to develop technical specifications for those practices.
Capacity 3: To develop CSA demonstration and dissemination activities and products (print and electronic) to inform and engage local government authorities, extension staff, academics, students, service providers, agribusiness leaders, and policy makers on how to apply CSA practices and achieve agricultural resilience.
Capacity 4: To ensure that all agriculture extension graduates are knowledgeable of the CSA approach, applicable practices, and how to modify application for different regions and cropping systems.
Capacity 5: To convert agrometeorological data and analyses into timely and actionable information available to farmers.</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), the World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) </p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in partnership with the United Republic of Tanzania</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p> </p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>No</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>None</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.tanzaniacsaalliance.or.tz/project/building-capacity-for-resilient-food-security-project-in-tanzania/</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Tanzania</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
