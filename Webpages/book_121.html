Strengthening capacities to cope with climate change impacts remains a priority, particularly in highly vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. While a comprehensive and coordinated response to climate change challenges is in the making, it is important to address specific adaptation needs at the local level, through the implementation of diversified and climate-resilient rural development strategies. This can yield useful results both in terms of climate change adaptation and transfer of capacity to local government authorities.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p> Enhance environmental sustainability and food security by strengthening the management of natural resources at the local level</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>To strengthen national capacities to cope with climate change impacts </p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Capacity building; Weather & Agroadvisory Services; Policy and advocacy</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>The Global Climate Change Alliance Plus Initiative</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>NGO</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>Min. of Finance, Division of Environment of the Vice-President's Office</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>EU</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>10.64 Million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Project contributed to gender equality</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.gcca.eu/programmes/gcca-tanzania-integrated-approaches-climate-change-adaptation</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
