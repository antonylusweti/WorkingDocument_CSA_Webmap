Neglect of these issues in policy and programming threatens sustainable growth of the agriculture sector and the wider economy.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>to mainstream consideration of cross-cutting issues into the Ministry of Agriculture’s planning, policy-making, monitoring, and evaluation.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>to build the capacity of Ministry staff by growing their technical understanding of cross-cutting issues, with a focus on developing experiential knowledge and analytical skills. Complementing this, a degree of organisational development is required to enhance productivity and institutional performance.
