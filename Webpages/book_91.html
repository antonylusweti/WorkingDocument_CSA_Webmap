This has a negative impact on agricultural productivity, with potentially disastrous consequences in a country in which more than 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence agriculture. Harsher climatic conditions require offsetting by increased investments in both soil conservation and irrigation. However, without clear land rights, farmers are often reluctant to make such investments. In this context, GCCA funding was provided to support the implementation of an ambitious land registration programme.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>To put in place an efficient, transparent and equitable system of land administration nationwide. </p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>Contribute to the implementation of the ‘Strategic Road Map for Land Tenure Reform’. This strategy aims to put in place a land tenure system that guarantees tenure security for all Rwandans and gives guidance to the necessary land reforms with a view to good management and rational use of national land resources. By providing security of tenure, land registration gives landholders greater incentive to care for the land on which their rights are firmly protected. Furthermore, the certificate of title issued at registration is accompanied by land use conditions that landholders are obligated to comply with. These conditions are crucial particularly in fragile areas such as wetlands and  high relief areas.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Markets, credit/ finance and value chains for CSA ; </p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Whole Country</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p></p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>Rwanda Natural Resources Authority, National Land Centre (Min. of Natural Resources)</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>5.38 Million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p></p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.gcca.eu/programmes/sector-budget-support-environment-and-natural-resources-rwanda</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
