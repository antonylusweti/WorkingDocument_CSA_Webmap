The regional approach will draw on the collective observation network of IGAD member states to improve the coverage, consistency and availability of regional climate information, using the convening power of IGAD to facilitate technical and climate information sharing mechanisms for increased information and services sharing across the region. The project will also provide technical assistance for mainstreaming climate information into national and regional policies and strategies, with specific focus on the agriculture sector. Finally, early action mechanisms will be established at the regional and national levels, including improved dissemination of early warnings and the development of preparedness and contingency plans for extreme climate events.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Weather & Agroadvisory Services; Capacity Building; Tools and Methodologies</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p></p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.greenclimate.fund/sites/default/files/document/24270-strengthening-climate-information-systems-climate-change-adaptation-greater-horn-africa.pdf</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
