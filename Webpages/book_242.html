There are three components to the project, the first component being Strengthening SAGCOT Support Institutions. This component will strengthen the capacity of SAGCOT Support Institutions in order to pursue their functions of information and data provision, support of investment planning and guidance, government/private sector intermediation, business enabling environment and investment promotion. The second component is the strengthening smallholder business linkages. The objective of this component will be to link smallholder farmers to agricultural value chains. The component will: (a) expand the number of smallholders linked to agribusinesses in successful commercial partnerships; and (b) improve the benefits derived by smallholders and rural communities from these partnerships in the form of growth in agricultural productivity, income, resilience to shocks, employment and improved food security. This component will comprise two sub-components: fund management, and matching grants. Finally, the third component is the project management and monitoring and evaluation. The component will establish project management and M&E systems and provide financing for salaries, office equipment, transportation and technical assistance services. Complementarities will particularly be sought with other IDA funded programs such as the Private Sector Competitiveness Project and the Agricultural Sector Development Program.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>is to increase the adoption of new technologies and marketing practices by smallholder farmers through expanding and creating partnerships between smallholder farmers and agribusinesses in the Southern Corridor of Tanzania.</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>(a) expand the number of smallholders linked to agribusinesses in successful commercial partnerships; and (b) improve the benefits derived by smallholders and rural communities from these partnerships in the form of growth in agricultural productivity, income, resilience to shocks, employment and improved food security.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Climate smart crops Markets, credit/finance and value chains for CSA; Capacity Building; Tools & methodologies;</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>MINISTRY OF FINANCE</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Government/Public sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>SAGCOT Catalytic Trust Fund, Prime Minister's Office, SAGCOT Centre, Tanzania Investment Centre</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>IDA57760</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>750 million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p></p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P125728</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Sarah Anne Simons, Emma Isinika Modamba, Pierre Olivier Colleye</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
