        <body><h1>Country</h1><p>Rwanda</p><h1>CSA Initiative</h1><p>Project</p><h1>Title</h1><p>Simple Urban Hydroponics</p><h1>3 Keywords</h1><p>Subsided inputs; Capacity Building; Urban Agriculture</p><h1>Start Year</h1><p>2017</p><h1>End Year</h1><p>2019</p><h1>Status</h1><p>Completed</p><h1>Synopsis</h1><p>This project aimed at manufacturing and providing subsidised hydroponics kits to low-income farmers in Kigali to provide an alternative means of growing leafy greens and vegetables using little water and without soil. Watering is manually carried out from an overhead tank by opening a water tap for only 4 minutes, three times a day. The contracting company also provided seeds, growth substrate and nutrients, as well as regular post-sales customer service and linking farmer produce to markets for sale.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>• Whether health and quality of life of families in crowded urban communities will improve
• Whether hydroponics will result to self-employment of idle household labour mostly women 
• Viability of our cheap hydro safe units (both PVC pipe and Net tube) most specifically how long it will take to break even in Rwandan contest.
•  Whether urban hydroponics sales and training can: 
o Be used to sustainably improve livelihoods of low-income urban women and youth and who will own the systems. 
o Bring opportunities for community participation and collaboration in urban agriculture. 
o Increase awareness of urban agriculture activities and their benefits to the community.
o  Enhance community acceptance by providing demonstrable projects.
o  Result in partnerships with citizens, community groups, and organizations that are also interested in urban agriculture and access to local food.
</p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a) Capacity building among the participants for them to engage in self-help projects. This strategy draws from the analogy of teaching the population how to fish, instead of giving fish. 
b) To promote family grown vegetable at home and herbs for export to get better income. </p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Smart water management: Tools and methodologies</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>No</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>Hydroponics Kenya</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Private sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>Hydroponics Rwanda Ltd, Aqua for All,Rwanda Agricultural Board, Hydroponics Africa Ltd, USAID</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>VIA Water,Hydroponics Rwanda Ltd</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>0.12 Million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p> Be used to sustainably improve livelihoods of low-income urban women and youth and who will own the systems. </p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.viawater.nl/projects/simple-urban-hydroponics</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
