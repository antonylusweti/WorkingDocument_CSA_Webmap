The large number of people farming on Rwanda’s hilly and mountainous terrain has led to serious environmental degradation due to overexploitation of the soil and extensive erosion. The farmed Northern and Western uplands of Rwanda are considered the most vulnerable to erosion due to their steeper terrain and higher annual rainfall. In addition to these unsustainable farming practices, there has been significant unplanned settlement in fragile and sensitive areas. Recent changes in the variability of rainfall have had a dramatic effect on these already highly perturbed ecosystems particularly in the mountainous North West part of the country which has experienced floods and landslides.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>manage the risks and effects from recurring floods, landslides and erosion through an integrated natural resource management and alternative livelihoods programme in one of the most climate sensitive and vulnerable areas of Rwanda. </p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>The objective of the project is to increase the adaptive capacity of natural systems and rural communities living in exposed areas of North Western Rwanda to climate change impacts. </p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>To be Updated</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>To be Updated</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>To be Updated</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>191'330</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>57'399</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>133'931</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>40'000</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>MINISTRY OF NATURAL RESOURCES (MINIRENA)</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Government/Public sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>National implemeting entity; RNRA</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>9.97 Million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p></p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>To be updated</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.adaptation-fund.org/project/reducing-vulnerability-to-climate-change-in-north-west-rwanda-through-community-based-adaptation/</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
