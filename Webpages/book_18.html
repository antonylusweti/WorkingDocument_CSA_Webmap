Current adaptive capacity is low and the country has Africa’s highest level of food insecurity, accompanied by high levels of malnutrition. Projected climate change impacts are significant and include a temperature increase above the mean global value, increasing variability in rainfall, more frequent dry spells and more severe droughts. The effects of these impacts on water resources and agriculture will exacerbate food insecurity.</p><h1>Goals</h1><p>The overall goal of the programme is to promote increased food security in Eritrea through ecologically sustainable and climate-resilient improvements in agricultural production. </p><h1>Objectives</h1><p>a) To increase community resilience and adaptive capacity to climate change through an integrated water management and agricultural development approach in the sub-zobas of Hamelmalo and Habero, Anseba Region; 
b) To increase the availability of water through floodwater harvesting and groundwater recharge; promote a range of climate-resilient technologies for enhanced agricultural and livestock production; 
c) Improve the dissemination of climate risk information among community, civil society and government stakeholders through a community-based early warning system; 
d) and capture and disseminate lessons learned through programme activities, and to influence policy through advocacy activities.</p><h1>CSA Activities and interventions</h1><p>Climate Smart Crops/Promotion of drought tolerant crops; Climate smart livestock practices/Livestock feed management/Improved breeds; Crop Disease and pest management; Livestock disease and pest management; Markets, credit/finance and value chains for CSA; Policy and Advocacy; Postharvest management; Renewable energy for CSA; Smart water management; Soil management; Weather & Agroadvisory Services; Capacity Building; Tools and Methodologies; Insurance</p><h1>Enhance opportunities to increase agricultural productivity (Food Security)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Improve resilience to climate change (Adaptation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Contribute to long-term reductions in dangerous greenhouse gas emission (Mitigation)</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Total Target Population</h1><p>30'705</p><h1>No. of Target Women Beneficaries</h1><p>9'212</p><h1>No. of Target Men Beneficaries</h1><p>21'494</p><h1>Hectares of Land Pastoral and Agricultural systems in which CSA practices have been adopted (ha)</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Lead Implementing institutions</h1><p>Ministry of Agriculture, Anseba Region, Eritrea</p><h1>Type of Lead Organization</h1><p>Government/Public sector</p><h1>Partner Organizations</h1><p>UNDP</p><h1>Financing mechanisms/Donors</h1><p>Adaptation Fund</p><h1>Cost of implementation in USD (Budget)</h1><p>6.52 Million</p><h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1><p>Yes</p><h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1><p>Focus on women-headed households and empowering people and institutions; improving knowledge and addressing the concerns of vulnerable groups (women and pastoralists)</p><h1>Website Url link</h1><p>https://www.adaptation-fund.org/project/climate-change-adaptation-programme-in-water-and-agriculture-in-anseba-region-eritrea/</p><h1>Location</h1><p>Unknown</p><h1>Contact Person</h1><p>The Adaptation Fund Board Secretariat</p><h1>Contact Person Email</h1><p>secretariat@adaptation-fund.org</p><h1>Comments</h1><p></p></body>
