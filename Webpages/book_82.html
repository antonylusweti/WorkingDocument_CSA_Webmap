    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>Adapting to Climate Change in Lake Victoria Basin (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda)</p>
    <h1>3 Keywords</h1>
    <p>Water Management; Lake Victoria Basin</p>
    <h1>Start Year</h1>
    <p>2018</p>
    <h1>End Year</h1>
    <p>2021</p>
    <h1>Status</h1>
    <p>Ongoing</p>
    <h1>Synopsis</h1>
    <p>The project will reduce the impact of climate change on local communities and water-dependent economic sectors
        within the LVB, the proposed project will increase climate resilience in the LVB at both a regional and local
        level by implementing both regional and community-based climate change adaptation interventions.</p>
    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p>The goals is to reduce vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change in the five Lake Victoria Basin
        countries by building climate resilience. </p>
    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p>a) Strengthened institutional and technical capacity to integrate climate resilience into transboundary water
        catchment management;
        b) Improved delivery of accurate and timely climate information to regional and national policymakers, technical
        officers and local communities;
        c) Climate change adaptation technologies transferred to communities to reduce their vulnerability to climate
        change;
        d) Regional resilience to climate change promoted through innovative, community-based projects;
        e) Improved knowledge management frameworks for the collection and maintenance of regional knowledge in
        transboundary water catchment management and climate change adaptation practices.</p>

    <h1>Gender & social inclusion</h1>
    <p>Yes</p>
    <h1>Gender & Social Inclusion Information</h1>
    <p>a) Gender considerations in climate change adaptation and water management; b) capacity-building activities
        undertaken in regional and national organisations will include a module on gender sensitivity. This training
        will promote the inclusion of gender-sensitive considerations in regional and national policies and strategies
        c) Gender equality will be a focal point of training and skills development in the proposed project. Women will
        gain the skills and exposure needed to increase their representation in community structures such as in
        community meetings and local user groups. </p>
